Input: 
    D = dataset of points
    ε = maximum neighbourhood radius
    min_samples = minimum number of neighbours to form a core point

Output:
    Clusters = list of point groups
    Noise = list of unclustered points

Initialize:
    All points in D as unvisited
    Clusters = []
    Noise = []

For each point P in D:
    If P is already visited:
        Continue
    Mark P as visited
    NeighbourPts = all points within distance ε of P

    If size of NeighbourPts < min_samples:
        Mark P as noise
        Add P to Noise
    Else:
        Create new cluster C
        Add P to C
        ExpandCluster(P, NeighbourPts, C, ε, min_samples)
        Add C to Clusters

Function ExpandCluster(P, NeighbourPts, C, ε, min_samples):
    For each point P_prime in NeighbourPts:
        If P_prime is not visited:
            Mark P_prime as visited
            NeighbourPts_prime = all points within distance ε of P'
            If size of NeighbourPts_prime ≥ min_samples:
                Add NeighbourPts_prime to NeighbourPts
        If P_prime is not yet in any cluster:
            Add P_prime to C
