# Identifying Urban Functional Regions

Josh Rimes (Student at Cardiff University)

Project start date: 16/01/25

This is my project for the 'CM3203 - Individual Project' module at Cardiff University.

## Project Overview

Urban functional regions are urban regions that perform different functions in cities. Examples include tourism regions, bank/financial regions, shopping regions, nighttime economy regions, food regions etc. The goal of this project is to find the impaxcts of urban planning by identifying the functional regions in two cities in an automated manner using Point of Interest (POI) data. A POI is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting. Examples include pubs, shops, gyms, restaurants etc. The POI data will be obtained from OpenStreetMap or the Ordnance Survey. 
Successfully achieving the goals of the project will require skills in data mining and analysis. Real-world data from UK cities including Cardiff will be used in the project.

### Summarised Initial Plan:
1. Look for different datasets that I can use. I can get POI data from the ordnance survey via [digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/) or from [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/51.4877/-3.1804). Maybe can also integrate other datasets such as city boundaries or census data.
2. Do a review of related works on the topic. This can be used to identify the data analysis methods that I plan to use.
3. Implement methods; I should be able to use existing software libraries.
4. Perform the analysis using above methods. I will compare different cities, different POI types, create nice visualisations etc.
5. Compare the success of functional regions in both cities to find insights on the impacts of urban layout.
6. Write the report.
